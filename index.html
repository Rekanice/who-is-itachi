    <p>The Naruto series captures the notion of suffering in silence for the greater good via the reserved Itachi Uchiha.
      The suffering he was shouldering is actually killing his entire clan (except his little brother, Sasuke whom he spared out of love)
      who planned to launch a coup de tat on the village. Itachi valued the peace of the village before his clan & went as far as to 
      kill his own blood, especially his parents. Itachi carried that pain with him without getting recognition for preserving harmony. 
      That was a real testament to what sincerity is. <br>
      <br>

      Why Itachi is a real man
      <ul>
        <li>He made the tough decisions</li>
        <li>He did those tough things without needing the recognition</li>
        <li>He was able to take all the blame & hate from people for doing the right thing</li>
      </ul><br><br>
